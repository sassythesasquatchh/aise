map output of models to correct domain using activation on 
output layer, if the end domain is known. In this task,
temperatures should not be below 1 or above 4

For Task 2, use different models for each domain. This prevents the difficult task
of learning regime changes. However, it becomes necessary to train the models
to agree at the interface
